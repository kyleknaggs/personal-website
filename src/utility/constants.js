  ONLINE_ORDERING_PLATFORM_WRITE_UP: 'As the largest mattress and foam manufacturer in the English speaking Caribbean, Advance Foam processes over 22,000 orders each year. With the launch of their new website in 2017, the company was eager to rethink how it traditionally accepted orders, a process that was not only burdensome on its customers, but on the company itself. After an intense period of research where each part of the order entry process was thoroughly documented and examined it became increasingly clear that a single page web application could help automate this time consuming and error prone process that was heavily reliant on human intervention. Once this decision was made, an ideal user flow was designed, mock ups were developed and the application was built with iterative feedback from stakeholders on a regular basis. The application processed its first order August 2018, and since then, many of the company’s major customers have adopted the web application as the primary means by which they create, place and manage orders. Product features were then added to the platform on a regular basis as a means of continually on-boarding new clients while simultaneously refining existing customers’ user experience.',
